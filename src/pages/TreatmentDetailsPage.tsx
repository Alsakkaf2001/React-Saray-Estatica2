        answer:
          "We use implants made from medical-grade titanium. This is the global standard for dental and medical implants, trusted for decades due to its unique biocompatibility‚Äîmeaning the human body accepts it as a natural part of itself. This allows for the strong, permanent bond to form with your jawbone, ensuring a safe and durable foundation for your new tooth.",

      {
        question: "What if I don't have enough bone for an implant?",
        answer:
          "This is a common situation that we are well-equipped to handle. If your 3D scan shows insufficient bone volume, your specialist may recommend a preliminary procedure like a bone graft or a sinus lift. These are safe and routine procedures designed to create a strong and healthy foundation to ensure the long-term success of your implant.",

        question: "Why are two visits to Istanbul necessary?",
        answer:
          "The two-visit process is crucial for the long-term success of your implant. The healing period between visits allows for 'osseointegration'‚Äîthe natural process where your jawbone fuses with the titanium implant. Rushing this critical step can compromise the stability of the implant. Our patient, two-step approach ensures we are building a permanent, reliable foundation for your new smile.",

          "A beard transplant is a procedure where artistry is paramount. The difference between a natural result and a poor one is the specialist's ability to replicate the subtle, unique patterns of facial hair growth. Our philosophy is grounded in this artistic precision. We partner with specialists who have a deep understanding of facial aesthetics and the meticulous skill required to place each graft perfectly, ensuring your result is masculine, authentic, and enhances your features.",

        question: "Will my new beard look natural?",
        answer:
          "Yes. This is our primary focus. The FUE technique allows the specialist to control the exact angle, direction, and density of each implanted hair, which is the key to creating a result that is indistinguishable from a natural beard.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is the procedure painful?",
        answer:
          "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so you will not feel pain in either the donor or recipient areas. Most patients report only minor discomfort for a day or two afterward, which is easily managed.",
      },
      {
        question: "Where does the hair for the transplant come from?",
        answer:
          "The hair is typically taken from a discreet area on the back of your scalp. This hair is genetically resistant to thinning and is an excellent match for facial hair in texture and quality.",
      },
      {
        question: "When will I see the final results?",
        answer:
          "Be patient, as it's a gradual process. The transplanted hairs will shed after a few weeks (this is normal). New, permanent growth will begin in about 3-4 months, with more significant density appearing around 6 months. The final, full result will be visible after about 10-12 months.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is the recovery like?",
        answer:
          "Recovery is quick. You will see small scabs on the implanted follicles for about 7-10 days. There may be some initial redness. Most patients feel comfortable returning to work and normal activities within a few days.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I shave or trim my new beard?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely. Once the initial healing period is over and the new hairs have grown in, you can treat your new beard exactly like the rest of your facial hair. You can shave it, trim it, or grow it long.",
      },
      {
        question: "How many grafts will I need?",
        answer:
          "This depends entirely on your goals‚Äîfrom filling in small patches to creating a full beard. During your free consultation, we will assess your needs and provide a clear recommendation for the number of grafts required to achieve your desired look.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much does a beard transplant cost?",
        answer:
